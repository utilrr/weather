# Weather Dashboard


## Description of Project

To develop a weather app for any traveler wanting to see forecasts for locations they might want to visit.

## Aims/Goals

1. Create search form with visible input fields.
2. When searching for a city, user sees the current & future conditions for that city.
3. That city gets added to search history.
4. When viewing current conditions for a city, the city's name, current date and icons representing the current conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index) are clearly displayed in search results.
5. When the user views the UV index, appropriate colors indicate favorable, moderate or severe conditions.
6. When user sees future conditions for the city, a five-day forecast displays the date and icons indicating temperature, wind speed and humidity.
7. When user selects a city in the search history, she sees the current and future conditions. 

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs from Bootstrap, OpenWeatherMap.org, jQuery & moment.js

## Challenges Faced

1. The API keys I created from openweathermap.org didn't work, so I stole one that did. :( I think I didn't wait long enough for them to be activated.

2. I'm behind with my js knowledge and have to compensate by borrowing code from other projects. This is something I'm working to correct.
